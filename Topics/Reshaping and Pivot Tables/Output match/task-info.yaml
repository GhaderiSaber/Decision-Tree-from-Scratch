  - I have a ton of values and a pair of categories; I want to evaluate my data and
    get an average or maybe a median.
  - I want to find which pairs of categories in my dataset are frequent and which are
    not.

    them into one column.
  - "For every pair of categories, I have only one corresponding value and want to make\
  \ my data more readable."
